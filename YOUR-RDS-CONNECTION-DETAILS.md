# 🎉 AWS RDS MySQL - Ready to Connect!

## 📊 **Your Database Details**

**Connection Information (from your RDS instance):**
```
Endpoint: vision-fyp-mysql.cfagcexv278j.ap-southeast-2a.rds.amazonaws.com
Port: 3306
Username: admin
Database: vision_fyp_management_system
Region: ap-southeast-2 (Sydney)
Status: Available (was backing up, should be ready now)
```

## 🔧 **Setup Your Environment File**

Copy this to your `.env` file in the Backend folder:

```env
# AWS RDS MySQL Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
DB_HOST=vision-fyp-mysql.cfagcexv278j.ap-southeast-2a.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_NAME=vision_fyp_management_system
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_MASTER_PASSWORD_HERE
DB_PORT=3306
DB_SSL=true

# Security (generate a new one)
JWT_SECRET=your-64-character-random-jwt-secret-key-minimum-64-characters-long
PORT=3000

# Frontend URL (update when deployed)
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vision-fyp-app.vercel.app

# Email Configuration
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
```

## 🧪 **Test Your Connection**

1. **Update the .env file** with your master password
2. **Run the connection test**:
```bash
cd Backend
node test-aws-connection.js
```

Expected output:
```
🧪 Testing AWS RDS MySQL Connection...
✅ Successfully connected to AWS RDS MySQL!
✅ Database created/verified
✅ MySQL Version: 8.0.35
🎉 AWS RDS MySQL connection test PASSED!
```

## 🔐 **Security Group Check**

From your screenshots, I can see the security group is configured, but let me verify the inbound rule:

**Required Rule:**
- Type: MySQL/Aurora
- Protocol: TCP  
- Port: 3306
- Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (for testing, restrict in production)

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Wait for "Available" status** (if not already)
2. **Update .env file** with your master password
3. **Test connection**: `node test-aws-connection.js`
4. **Start your app**: `npm run dev`
5. **Deploy to production**

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Master Password**: You created this during RDS setup - make sure you remember it!
- **Free Tier**: You're using db.t4g.micro (free for 12 months) ✅
- **Region**: ap-southeast-2 (Sydney) - good choice for Asia-Pacific users
- **Backup**: Your instance was backing up, which is normal after creation

## 🆘 **If Connection Fails**

Check these common issues:
1. **Wrong password** - Use the master password you created
2. **Security group** - Ensure port 3306 is open
3. **RDS status** - Must be "Available" (not "Backing-up")
4. **Endpoint spelling** - Copy exactly from AWS console

**Your RDS instance is ready! Just need your master password to complete the setup.** 🎯
