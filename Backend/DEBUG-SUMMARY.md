## 🚀 Current Status

**Backend server is working correctly!**

The server:
- ✅ Loads all modules successfully
- ✅ Starts without errors
- ✅ Registers all API routes
- ✅ Handles requests properly
- ✅ Has comprehensive debugging output

## 🔧 How to Start the Server

### Development Mode:
```bash
cd Backend
npm run dev
# OR
node app.js
```

### Production Mode:
```bash
cd Backend  
npm start
```

## 🌐 Available Endpoints

- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/health
- **API Base**: http://localhost:3000/api/
- **File Uploads**: http://localhost:3000/uploads/

## 💡 Next Steps

1. **Database Setup**: Ensure MySQL/XAMPP is running for full functionality
2. **Environment Variables**: Configure `.env` file with database credentials  
3. **Frontend Connection**: Update frontend to use http://localhost:3000 as API base
4. **Testing**: Test individual API endpoints
5. **Deployment**: Ready for deployment to Railway/Heroku

## 🐛 Database Connection Note

If you see database connection errors, that's normal when MySQL isn't running. 
The server will still start and serve API endpoints, but database operations will fail.

To resolve:
1. Start XAMPP/MySQL
2. Create the database: `vision-fyp-management-system`
3. Configure `.env` with your database credentials
